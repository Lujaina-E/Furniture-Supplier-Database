# Furniture-Supplier-Database
A program intended to store and sell objects from an inventory filled with different models of different items, as can be personalized for every store's inventory. The program  will ask the user a series of questions to identify what they wish to purchase. Based on the user's questions, the program will manipulate, store, or display the item's properties. There are also sorting and search algorithms to help the user with the selection process.

# How it Works
The user will first enter the size of their room, and then follow the series of questions asked. They will run the user through the items stored in inventory, as well as the styles of each item, and then ask if they want to buy the object. The user will also have the chance to use sorting and search algorithms to find products suitable for their desired look, style, budget, etc. At the end, the program will print out the objects that the user has bought and the prices, as a form of receipt for their order. 
# Challenges
Since this is a work in progress, there are many challenges. They are already commented on in the code specific to where they exist, so I will not repreat them here. 

# What I Learned

{ Since I'm still working on the project, I'll add stuff here as I go... }
I've become much more comfortable using ArrayLists now that I've had to retrieve all sorts of properties and information through OOP using Arraylists.

# Features for the Future
- A memory clear system allowing the customer to clear their current count of items and start over (similar to the "clear cart" function on a website)
- Implementation of bubble sort algorithm
